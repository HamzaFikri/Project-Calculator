A calculator project coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a web-based application that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations through a user interface. 
The HTML provides the structure of the calculator interface, CSS is used to style and layout the interface, 
and JavaScript is used to provide the functionality for performing the calculations. 
The calculator can take user input through button clicks or keyboard input and display the results in real-time on the interface. 
The project may include additional features such as memory functions or scientific calculations, depending on the scope of the project.
